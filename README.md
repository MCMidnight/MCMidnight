# Midnight's Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Midnight** (he/him), a passionate C# developer diving deep into game development with Unity. I've been coding in C# since August 2024: over a year of hands-on experience. I love coding in the background, tinkering on side projects whenever inspiration strikes. And I'm always up for collaborating on fun projects!

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Doing
- Gaining real-world **work experience** in C# programming.
- Building my skills in **game development**, from core mechanics to polished experiences.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Advanced Unity workflows, including scripting, optimization, and asset integration.
- UI/UX design for games, like dynamic HUDs and intuitive menus.
- Game development fundamentals through a college program in the UK.
- C++ basics, planning to dive in later this year.

## 👯 Let's Collaborate!
I'm eager to team up on:
- Indie game prototypes or full releases.
- C# tools, scripts, or automation projects.
- Open-source contributions in game dev or general programming.

Got an idea? Shoot me a message. Let's make something awesome!

## 💼 Experience Highlights
- **38+ Private Commissions**: Delivered custom C# solutions, all built in Unity.
  - Focused on gameplay systems, mechanics, and backend logic.
  - Integrated UI elements like HUDs, team management menus, and engaging start screens.
- Developed a **C# Discord bot** for community management and automation.
- Total coding time: **13+ months** of dedicated C# practice and professional work.
