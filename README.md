# Midnight's Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Midnight** (he/him), a passionate C# developer diving deep into game development with Unity. I've been coding in C# since August 2024: over a year of hands-on experience. I love coding in the background, tinkering on side projects whenever inspiration strikes. And I'm always up for collaborating on fun projects!

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Doing
- Gaining real-world **work experience** in C# programming.
- Building my skills in **game development**, from core mechanics to polished experiences for users in the background.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Advanced Unity workflows, including scripting, optimization, and asset integration.
- UI/UX design for games, like dynamic HUDs and intuitive menus.
- Game development fundamentals through a college program in the UK.
- C++ basics, planning to dive in later this year.

## 👯 Let's Collaborate!
I'm eager to team up on:
- Indie game prototypes or full releases.
- C# tools, scripts, or automation projects.
- Open-source contributions in game dev or general programming.

I'm also down for **part-time freelance work** on C# and Unity projects! If you're looking to hire for custom scripts, game features, or anything in between, hit me up. Let's turn your ideas into code.

Got an idea? Shoot me a message. Let's make something awesome!

## 💼 Experience Highlights

  - Focused on gameplay systems, mechanics, and backend logic.
  - Integrated UI elements like HUDs, team management menus, and engaging start screens.
